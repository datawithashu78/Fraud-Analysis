#  Fraud Transaction Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes financial transactions to uncover fraud patterns using data analytics and visualization techniques.  
The goal is to identify **high-risk behavior, fraud trends, suspicious customers, devices, regions, and transaction patterns**.


##  Business Problems Solved
The analysis answers key fraud-related questions:

1. What is the overall fraud rate?
2. Which transaction types and devices have the highest fraud rate?
3. Who are the most fraudulent customers?
4. What locations and merchants show repeated fraud cases?
5. At what time/day does fraud happen most?
6. Are high-value transactions more fraudulent?
7. Which channels or devices are the riskiest?
8. Which regions have the highest fraud density?
9. What behavioral patterns indicate suspicious activities?



##  Tech Stack
- **Python** (pandas, seaborn, matplotlib)
- **SQL (SQLite)** for querying structured transaction data
- **Jupyter Notebook** for analysis & visualization


##  Key Insights (Examples you can update after running)
- Fraud percentage across all transactions was calculated
- Certain devices/channels show significantly higher fraud rate
- Fraud spikes during specific hours/days
- A small group of customers contributes to majority fraud cases
- Some cities and merchants show repeated suspicious activity
- High-value transactions show stronger fraud correlation
